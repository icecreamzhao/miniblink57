	// Terminology:
	//    * The 'top level domain' (TLD) of an internet domain name is
	//      the terminal "." free substring (e.g. "com" for google.com
	//      or world.std.com).
	//    * The 'effective top level domain' (eTLD) is the longest
	//      "." initiated terminal substring of an internet domain name
	//      that is controlled by a general domain registrar.
	//      (e.g. "co.uk" for news.bbc.co.uk).
	//    * The 'effective top level domain plus one' (eTLD+1) is the
	//      shortest "." delimited terminal substring of an internet
	//      domain name that is not controlled by a general domain
	//      registrar (e.g. "bbc.co.uk" for news.bbc.co.uk, or
	//      "google.com" for news.google.com).  The general assumption
	//      is that all hosts and domains under an eTLD+1 share some
	//      administrative control.

	// CookieMap is the central data structure of the CookieMonster.  It
	// is a map whose values are pointers to CanonicalCookie data
	// structures (the data structures are owned by the CookieMonster
	// and must be destroyed when removed from the map).  The key is based on the
	// effective domain of the cookies.  If the domain of the cookie has an
	// eTLD+1, that is the key for the map.  If the domain of the cookie does not
	// have an eTLD+1, the key of the map is the host the cookie applies to (it is
	// not legal to have domain cookies without an eTLD+1).  This rule
	// excludes cookies for, e.g, ".com", ".co.uk", or ".internalnetwork".
	// This behavior is the same as the behavior in Firefox v 3.6.10.

	// NOTE(deanm):
	// I benchmarked hash_multimap vs multimap.  We're going to be query-heavy
	// so it would seem like hashing would help.  However they were very
	// close, with multimap being a tiny bit faster.  I think this is because
	// our map is at max around 1000 entries, and the additional complexity
	// for the hashing might not overcome the O(log(1000)) for querying
	// a multimap.  Also, multimap is standard, another reason to use it.
	// TODO(rdsmith): This benchmark should be re-done now that we're allowing
	// subtantially more entries in the map.
